# Binary sequences meet the Fibonacci sequence

This repository contains all Walnut files and commands used in the paper. They are compatible with Walnut 5 (and newer versions), which can be downloaded from
https://github.com/firetto/Walnut

**The contents of the folders are as follows:**

- **Command Files:** contains separate files with Walnut commands used in Sections 3 and 5, respectively. These commands can be executed in one go by copying the files into the folder /Walnut/Command Files and executing in Walnut:
  
load file_name.txt;

Note that some commands require downloading the files from Transducer library and Word Automata Library folders and copying them into corresponding Walnut folders (see below)

- **Results:** contains results of the above commands. These are created automatically by Walnut in the folder /Walnut/Results.

- **Transducer library:** contains the file Tr9.txt which should be copied into the folder /Walnut/Transducer Library

- **Word Automata Library:** contains the file K.txt and K1.txt which should be copied into the folder /Walnut/Word Automata Library
